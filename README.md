# A simple chat with socket

This app was a work for my graduation in Computer Engineering.

# Server
A socket python server. To run this use:
```
cd server
python2 server.py
```

To test the socket execute the `client.py` script:
```
python2 client.py
```

# Client
The Android application chat client. It is an android studio project. To change it just import in android studio and run as a normal application.
